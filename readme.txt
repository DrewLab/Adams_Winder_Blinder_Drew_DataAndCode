#Instructions for replicating analysis

The code blocks in the statistical supplement contain commands in the "R" scripting language. To replicate the reported results the contents of the code blocks can be copied and pasted into the R-command line or the entire contents of the .rmd document can be loaded into R-Studio and run.

The data can be found in two .csv files in the data folder.

In order to run the code, the "tidyverse", "lme4", "multcomp", and "knitr" packages must be installed into R.
